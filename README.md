## :bookmark: About

A web-site created only with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
</br>
It was made thinking in simplicity, functionality and with love s2.

:small_blue_diamond: 1. My first idea was to create something simple following the minimalist style but functional and user friendly. So I looked into some portfolios to have ideas to how to build my site structure and main color palette.

:small_blue_diamond: 2. For the Home page I made it simple, I got a new font from Google Fonts called [Dancing Script](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dancing+Script) for my name and for the rest of the webSite I used the font [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito). 

:small_blue_diamond: 3. I create a small carousel to show in three languages a welcome message on the Home page, just to say hello :wave: to everyone who visits my website :smile:

:small_blue_diamond: 4. For the About and FAC pages I create a structure that I got inspired for [Jumbotrom](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/jumbotron/) from Bootstrap (Just the layout I mean :smile:). In my opinion that is a good way to show to the user some information in text.

:small_blue_diamond: 5. The next part was the Work section where I show some of the work that I have done so far with programming. For my projects I decided to use a carousel to show my projects, and I also put two playable games that I've created during the first lockdown :smile:. 

:small_blue_diamond: 6. For the carousel structure I used some JS features like the [EventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventListener) with the references [mouseenter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mouseenter_event) event and [mouseleave](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mouseleave_event) event to make the carousel stop when the mouse cursor is over it and restart when the cursor leaves.

:small_blue_diamond: 7. The whole website uses a scroll show feature to show the structures when the user scrolls the page down. To achieve this I used a structure from JS called [getBoundingClientRect().top](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect) which returns the small distance value from the top of the element until top of the screen as well as the [scroll](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/scroll_event) event to trigger the function.
