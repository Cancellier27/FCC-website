## :bookmark: About

A web-site created only with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
</br>
It was made thinking in simplicity, functionality and with love s2.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
 
:scroll: A brief description of the steps that I used to build this page. Enjoy :hearts: 

:small_blue_diamond: 1. My first idea was to create something simple following the minimalist style, functional and user friendly. So I looked into some portfolios to have ideas to how to build my site structure and main color palette.

:small_blue_diamond: 2. For the Home page I made it simple, I got a new font from Google Fonts called [Dancing Script](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dancing+Script) for my name and for the rest of the webSite I used the font [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito). 

:small_blue_diamond: 3. I create a small carousel to show in three languages a welcome message on the Home page, just to say hello :wave: to everyone who visits my website :smile:

:small_blue_diamond: 4. For the About and FAC pages I create a structure that I got inspired for [Jumbotrom](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/jumbotron/) from Bootstrap (Just the layout I mean :smile:). In my opinion that is a good way to show to the user some information in text.

:small_blue_diamond: 5. The next part was the Work section where I show some of the work that I have done so far with programming. For my projects I decided to use a carousel to show my projects, and I also put two playable games that I've created during the first lockdown :smile:. 

:small_blue_diamond: 6. For the carousel structure I used some JS features like the [EventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventListener) with the references [mouseenter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mouseenter_event) event and [mouseleave](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mouseleave_event) event to make the carousel stop when the mouse cursor is over it and restart when the cursor leaves.

:small_blue_diamond: 7. The whole website uses a scroll show feature to show the structures when the user scrolls the page down. To achieve this I used a structure from JS called [getBoundingClientRect().top](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect) which returns the small distance value from the top of the element until top of the screen as well as the [scroll](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/scroll_event) and the [DOMContentLoaded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/DOMContentLoaded_event) events to trigger the function.

:small_blue_diamond: 8. The site pallet is composed basically by two collors ![#272727](https://via.placeholder.com/15/272727/000000?text=+) `#272727` and ![#ffe400](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffe400/000000?text=+) `#ffe400`. I took this colors because yellow is the color which symbolizes optimism, energy and joy, so it appeared to be the right choice for this page, and also this two colors remind me from the city in Brazil that I used to work :smile:

:small_blue_diamond: 9. For the header, which comes at the beginning but I think that was the part of the page that I most changed along the building process :joy:. I created a simple header which gets [fixed](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp) at the top of the page and when the page gets smaller than a predefined width it changes to a [hamburger](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_menu_icon.asp) menu to fit all the elements without breaking the layout of the page.

:small_blue_diamond: 10. Finally, all the images on the page have been compressed to make them smaller and make the site faster, not causing the site to load a lot of data for the images here. For this I used a random website online to compress images to a web format :smile:
